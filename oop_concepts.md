# Object oriented programming concepts

## Abstraction

Abstract means a concept or an Idea which is not associated with any particular instance.
Data abstraction refers to providing only essential information about the data to
the outside world, hiding the background details or implementation.

## Encapsulation

Encapsulation is defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit. It is the
mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates. In Encapsulation, the
variables or data of a class are hidden from any other class and can be accessed only
through any member function of their class in which they are declared (data hiding).

## Inheritance

The capability of a class to derive properties and characteristics from another class
is called Inheritance. When we write a class, we inherit properties from other classes.
So when we create a class, we do not need to write all the properties and functions
again and again, as these can be inherited from another class that possesses it.
Inheritance allows the user to reuse the code whenever possible and reduce its redundancy.

## Polymorphism

The word polymorphism means having many forms. In simple words, we can define polymorphism
as the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form.

Typically if we include inheritance, polymorphism makes possible to call code
independently of which class in the supported hierarchy it is operating on (base classes
and derived classes can be called like they were similar objects).

Static polymorphism is achieved using method overloading and dynamic polymorphism using
method overriding. It is closely related to inheritance. We can write a code that works
on the superclass, and it will work with any subclass type as well.
